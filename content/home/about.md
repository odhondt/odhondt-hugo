# Biography

Since September 2011 I am a Researcher at TU-Berlin (Technical University of Berlin) in the Computer Vision and Remote Sensing Group.

From November 2007 to January 2011, I was a Research Scientist at the Barcelona Media Research Center in Barcelona, Spain.

From March 2006 to October 2007, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow and stayed as an invited member with the Remote Sensing Laboratory, from the Signal Theory and Communications Department TSC, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. I was also with the Geophysical Imagery team from the Geosciences Rennes Laboratory, University of Rennes 1, France. 

I received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in Signal Processing and Telecommunication in 2006, both from the University of Rennes 1, France.
